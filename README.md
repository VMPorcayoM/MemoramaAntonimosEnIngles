# MemoramaAntonimosEnIngles

Memorama (memory game) with antonyms in the English language.

In the project you can see the Java code of a platform memory game,
which consists of identifying the antonyms of the English language and relating them to each other (in pairs) until all the letters are uncovered.

It has the ability to give us a different order of the cards for each game we start, making use of the shuffle method to randomly order our cards in an ArrayList object.

Also once we finish playing it tells us the time in seconds that it takes to complete the game. It has the clock at the top of the board, updating itself every second that passes the game.
It counts the successes that we have in real time and the attempts that correspond to the errors that we have made in the game.
The game and its instructions are in Spanish.
